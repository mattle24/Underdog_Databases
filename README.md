# Underdog Databases

Underdog Databases is a project designed to make data management widely
available to progress campaigns, organizations, and movements. Every organizer
is limited by the time they and their volunteers have. To make the biggest impact,
organizers must be able to prioritize voter contacts tailored to the specific
circumstances of the campaign. Without a data management platform, this type of targeting
becomes exponentially more difficult.
