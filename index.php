                    <p>
                        Grassroots Analytics is a platform built for small campaigns. We started Grassroots after being able access an updated voter file before the 2016 election. Our goal is to create a platform so that any progressive campaign, no matter the size, can use data to inform their positions. [Should talk about why we value data]

                    <p>
                        Whether you are a city council or presidential campaign, you want to maximize your voter contact efforts. Time spent on voters that do not support your candidate is time you cannot spend talking to your potential supporters. By using a data-driven approach you can maximize your efforts and win crucial votes.
